ztools - Random Administrator Tools
===================================

.toc

## Why?

We've been developing various scripts and tools to help package and test 0MQ, and we have no clear home for these tools. They may be 'just' shell scripts, but they represent hours and days of work. We want a place they will be safe, so a git.

## What?

Currently:

* Tools to help with the daily builds.
* Tools to help build sites like api.zero.mq

## How?

Each tool has its own directory which includes basic instructions on how to install and use. These are not meant as end-user toys, so if you intend to use the tools for other projects, contact the author for help.
