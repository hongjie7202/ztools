<A name="toc2-9" title="Why?" />
## Why?

We've been developing various scripts and tools to help package and test Ã˜MQ, and we have no clear home for these tools. They may be 'just' shell scripts, but they represent hours and days of work. We want a place they will be safe, so a git.

<A name="toc2-14" title="What?" />
## What?

Currently:

* Tools to help with the daily builds.
* Tools to help build sites like api.zero.mq

<A name="toc2-22" title="How?" />
## How?

Each tool has its own directory which includes basic instructions on how to install and use. These are not meant as end-user toys, so if you intend to use the tools for other projects, contact the author for help.
